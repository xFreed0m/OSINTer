# OSINTer
bash script to prepare Debian machines for OSINT use

part of TraceLabs [OSINT CTF](https://www.tracelabs.org/getinvolved/ctf/) I've prepare a script to automate the installation of
many OSINT tools.

## How to use it
Oneliner to download and install
```
sudo wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xFreed0m/OSINTer/master/OSINTer.sh | bash
```
 
### Compatibility
This was tested with Ubuntu Desktop 19.10

### Credit
This bases __heavily__ on @g0tmi1k amazing os-scripts [repo](https://github.com/g0tmi1k/os-scripts), i've made small changes\additions 
to adjust it to my needs and liking.

### Roadmap
* add this script to TerraForm automation to create cloud based VMs
* add more OSINT tools
* debug some of the less straight-forward tools installations
* test on more OS versions

### Issues, bugs and other code-issues
Yeah, I know, this code isn't the best. I'm fine with it as I'm not a developer and this is part of my learning process.
If there is an option to do some of it better, please, let me know.

_Not how many, but where._

v.01 - alpha
